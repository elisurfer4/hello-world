# hello-world
My first repository

Hey Everyone:
I am brand new to coding, developing, programming, etc.  I really want to learn more about it and I think it is a very excited industry that I could fit into very well.  I am a nature lover and a die hard surfer, which I feel is something you don't see too often in the tech world.  I want to do big things that can change the way people operate in the world we live in... I hope to be on the road to accomplishing some of those big things now!
